# Real-time SSD Object Detection

> Gstreamer, Opencv, Tensort camera pipeline

## Materials

1. Jetson hardware with camera CSI attachment. See the [previous article](https://seanavery.github.io/jetson-nano-box/#/) for details on how to build.
2. Need to have OpenCV installed. See [instructions](https://jkjung-avt.github.io/opencv-on-nano/) from  JK Jung's blog.
